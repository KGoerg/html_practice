    <h1>I Love My Family</h1>
        <h2>Thankfulness</h2>
            <p>I want to spend some time explaining why I'm thankful for each of my family members. It's important to stop, reflect, and be grateful. We've had a lot of ups and downs and now, things are peaceful, so there's plenty to be thankful for!</p>
            <p>I'm very fortunate to have a loving family consisting of my husband, Aaron, and my two cats, Gaia and Hot Sauce. <strong>Gaia</strong> and <strong>Hot Sauce</strong> are two one-and-a-half year old cats who keep me on my toes and help make our household a joy to live in!</p>
        <h3>Aaron</h3>
            <p><strong>Aaron</strong> is a wonderful person who makes me laugh every day and makes me feel <em>so loved.</em> I've known him since 2015, when we first met at <strong>Illinois State University</strong> shortly before our freshman year ended. I thought he seemed nice and I could tell he was talented -- he was making his own music and showed off his creativity during our Dungeons & Dragons session, which is where I first laid eyes on him. I knew I wanted to get to know him better, and coincidentally, he grew up in a city half an hour away from where I grew up, and we were heading to our parents' homes for the summer, so we were able to see each other very easily for a couple of months before we started back at ISU!</p>
