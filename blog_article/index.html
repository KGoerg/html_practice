    <h1>I Love My Family</h1>
        <p>I want to spend some describing the members of my family and reflecting on why I'm thankful for each of them. It's important to stop, reflect, and be grateful. We've had a lot of ups and downs at the start of 2025, but now things are peaceful, so there's plenty to be thankful for!</p>

        <p>I'm very fortunate to have a loving family consisting of my husband, <strong>Aaron</strong>, and my two cats, <strong>Gaia</strong> and <strong>Hot Sauce.</strong>


    <h2>Aaron</h2>
        <strong>Aaron</strong> is a wonderful person who makes me laugh every day and makes me feel <em>so loved.</em> I've known him since 2015, when we first met at <strong>Illinois State University</strong> shortly before our freshman year ended. I thought he seemed nice and I could tell he was talented -- he was making his own music and showed off his creativity during our Dungeons & Dragons session, which is where I first laid eyes on him. I knew I wanted to get to know him better, and coincidentally, he grew up in a city half an hour away from where I grew up, and we were heading to our parents' homes for the summer, so we were able to see each other very easily for a couple of months before we started back at ISU! We dated through the rest of college and have been together ever since, eventually <em>getting married</em> on November 8th, 2024. We're coming up on our one year marriage anniversary soon, which is exciting!</p>
        
        <p>Aaron is my other half and keeps me balanced. I'm so grateful to love someone so inspiring and encouraging, who understands me, and to have someone that makes life feel <em>so much</em> easier. He's a great cat-dad and it warms my heart every day to see how much love he has to give our little babies, and to me. If you're reading this, my love, I hope you know you're the best thing to happen to me and I'm so proud of the life we've built together so far. </p>
        

    <h2>Gaia & Hot Sauce</h2>
        <p><strong>Gaia</strong> and <strong>Hot Sauce</strong> are our two one-and-a-half year old cats who keep me on my toes and help make our household a joy to live in! They were born in early March of 2024 and were adopted by Aaron and I on August 8, 2024. As of writing this blog, tomorrow is actually their one year adoption day!</p>
         
    <h3>Gaia</h3>
        <p><strong>Gaia</strong> has arguably changed the most since we adopted her. After keeping her and her brother locked in our bathroom for a week to decompress and to ensure no signs of ringworm were visible (long story), Gaia started showing signs of illness. The vet found she had a fever and, after some fluids and monitoring, we brought her home.</p>
           
        <p>The same thing happened about a month later. However, after fluids were administered and we brought her home, she displayed <strong>anisocoria</strong>, which meant her pupils were two different sizes. After a lot of back and forth with her regular vet and an opthalmologist over the span of a few months, we learned Gaia had <strong>Feline Leukemia Virus</strong>, also known as <strong>FeLV.</strong> FeLV weakens a cat's immune system, which means the eye infections and inflammation her opthalmologist identified were more difficult than usual to treat.</p>
           
        <p>Eventually, the inflammation won, and both of her eyes were removed in February of 2025, but she is now happier than ever! We also learned in July 2025 that her FeLV is regressive, which means her immune system is keeping up with the virus and she's not contagious, nor is she as likely to develop serious illnesses due to the virus!</p>

        <p>Gaia is an incredibly silly little girl who loves to snuggle with me and give me what we lovingly call <em>leaping huggies</em>, where instead of rubbing against my legs like cats usually do, she also does a little jump up against my legs. She has started waiting for me at the door when I come home, and sometimes I can hear her squeaking at the door when I leave, as if she's saying, "Come back! Don't go!!". She's a little love bug with a wild side, which her brother can definitely attest to -- even though she's blind, she likes to chase and pounce on him. She lights up my life and has taught me so much about resilience. Every time I look at her, I'm so grateful that she's still with us, since things got hairy when her eyes were at their worst. My Little Love keeps my heart full.</p>
        
        
    <h3>Hot Sauce</h3>
        <p><strong>Hot Sauce</strong>, truly better known as "Sauce", is a sweet, big lover boy who is oh so silly! He's not as spicy as his name implies -- in fact, we joke that he's more of a <em>Teddy Graham</em> than a Hot Sauce, if we're sticking with food! He loves to give hugs and snuggles almost every day with Aaron on the couch. He's a papa's boy, for sure, but he still loves me too :)</p>

        <p>Sauce makes me laugh so hard every single day with his antics. He gets the zoomies practically every day and dives into his tent in our bedroom, or jumps and slides into the brown packing paper we've left on the living room floor for him (he likes to burrow under it and search for toys).</p>

        <p>I've never met a gentler, kinder soul than him. He's a beautiful balance of chaos (as all cats are) and pure love. He's very intelligent and likes to figure out how things work, like sliding open the coat closet doors, or understanding how reflections work. He has an especially cute little baby face, which I think is going to stick with him no matter how old he gets.</p>

        <p>I'm so grateful to have such a sweet little guy in Sauce. He's very polite and makes my life feel so much richer with him around. Seeing how he interacts with his sister, knowing what she's gone through and being there to support her, makes me smile. He's the perfect little man and I'm so lucky we have him</p>

        
    <h2>Reflection</h2>
        
        <p>Overall, I want to note just how <em>absolutely lucky</em> I am to have these three in my life. Our little family is perfect, and I'm so happy we all have each other. We keep each other going, and we always will.</p>
