    <h1>I Love My Family</h1>
        <h2>Thankfulness</h2>
            <p>I want to spend some time explaining why I'm thankful for each of my family members. It's important to stop, reflect, and be grateful. We've had a lot of ups and downs at the start of 2025, but now things are peaceful, so there's plenty to be thankful for!</p>
            <p>I'm very fortunate to have a loving family consisting of my husband, <strong>Aaron</strong>, and my two cats, <strong>Gaia</strong> and <strong>Hot Sauce.</strong>
        <h3>Aaron</h3>
            <strong>Aaron</strong> is a wonderful person who makes me laugh every day and makes me feel <em>so loved.</em> I've known him since 2015, when we first met at <strong>Illinois State University</strong> shortly before our freshman year ended. I thought he seemed nice and I could tell he was talented -- he was making his own music and showed off his creativity during our Dungeons & Dragons session, which is where I first laid eyes on him. I knew I wanted to get to know him better, and coincidentally, he grew up in a city half an hour away from where I grew up, and we were heading to our parents' homes for the summer, so we were able to see each other very easily for a couple of months before we started back at ISU! We dated through the rest of college and have been together ever since, eventually <strong><em>getting married</em></strong> on November 8th, 2024. We're coming up on our one year marriage anniversary soon, which is exciting!</p>
            <p><strong>Aaron</strong> is my other half and keeps me balanced. I'm so grateful to have someone so inspiring and encouraging, who understands me, and to have someone that makes life feel <em>so much</em> easier. He's a great cat-dad and it warms my heart every day to see how much love he has to give our little babies, and to me. If you're reading this, my love, I hope you know you're the best thing to happen to me and I'm so proud of the life we've built together so far. </p>
        <h3>Gaia & Hot Sauce</h3>
            <p><strong>Gaia</strong> and <strong>Hot Sauce</strong> are our two one-and-a-half year old cats who keep me on my toes and help make our household a joy to live in!</p>
